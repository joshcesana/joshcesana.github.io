# Planning - FTW!

In my [previous post](/please_k_i_s_s) about keeping things simple, I talked about how my lack of keeping things simple kept me from making timely progress. In that time period of my studies, I discovered that focusing on one thing at a time and keeping things simple is how I can make efficient and profitable progress.

Even something as simple as writing this blog post forces me to put this in to practice. I have stubbed out each paragraph and each heading in order to get me in the right frame of mind. Of course, flexibility is possible and often requried, but basic planning often promotes progress.

**Progress makes me feel good.**

I'm not saying this method is for everyone, but it has surely brought value to my success here at Flatiron School.

When working on a project with many moving parts, instead of having an eye on all of the parts (as I mistakingly did before), I prefer to break things down in to small parts, and focus on one item at a time. Much like getting 'all greens' while testing code, this method (for me at least) is much more manageable and lets me work with a clear goal in mind.

## Visual Planning Tool

I stumbled upon [this interesting planning tool/spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XJSYlEeR9UGgsum36cKJalVUXnpuC-hER9b7NaR2PCU/edit?usp=sharing) when I was randomly googling **project planning** and **tracking.**

There's a screenshot of this spreadsheet below. Basically, if you fill in the proper dates and whatever lesson plans or project tasks you want, you get a visual representation of the work you need to do, and by the time you want to finish it. You have the progress summary going up top, with each individual task planned out, all calculated when you fill in the proper completed %.

Nifty!

## So what?

Overlooking and planning projects in a timely, efficient manner, is an extremely valuable skill that will get you far in any industry, including programming.

Fine tuning and optimizing this skill will pay dividends. Start small and try something simple to help up your planning game. Whether it be to jot down a plan of your day, your week, or your taking some time to plan out your month.

Don't beat yourself up if you can't live up to your schedule to a T, but I guarantee you that your frame of mind will be in a better place when it comes to your studying and projects.

As promised, a screenshot of the useful spreadsheet is below. Fill in your tasks and dates and you're on your way! [Download found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XJSYlEeR9UGgsum36cKJalVUXnpuC-hER9b7NaR2PCU/edit?usp=sharing).

**Happy Planning!**
